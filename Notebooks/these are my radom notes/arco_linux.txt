Here we just want to update and get on with our work.

You can use these commands as you see fit.
We have added the frequency behind it as indication. Again you are free to do it differently.

**update** – ArcoLinux packages, third-party packages build for ArcoLinux and Arch Linux packages  – //DAILY//

**upall** – updating all AUR packages – any package you installed additionally – //DAILY//

**skel** – copy/pasting /etc/skel content to your home directory and making a backup of .config folder – //MONTHLY//

**cb** – copy/pasting content from /etc/skel/.bashrc to ~/.bashrc + making it work (source) – //MONTHLY//

For Arch Linux users
