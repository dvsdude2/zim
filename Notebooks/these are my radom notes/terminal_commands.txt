If you want to move/copy from .directory to the Desktop:
mv /path/to/.directory/filename ~/Desktop
cp /path/to/.directory/filename ~/Desktop

Alternatively, if you want to move/copy from the Desktop into .directory:
mv ~/Desktop/filename /path/to/.directory
cp ~/Desktop/filename /path/to/.directory

The difference between mv and cp is:

mv will move a file (the file at origin gets destroyed).

cp will copy a file (you get to keep the file at origin).
