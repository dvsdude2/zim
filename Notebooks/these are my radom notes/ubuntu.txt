pling themes
Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only 
- or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 
            2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; 
and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only 
- or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 
           2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
