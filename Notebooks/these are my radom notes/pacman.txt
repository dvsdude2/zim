== Installing package(s) ==
Installing a package with pacman is really easy. Just run the following command:

sudo pacman -S <package_name_1>

In cases, you may just want to download the package. Pacman can be used to perform the action for you. Just use the “-Sw” flag.

sudo pacman -Sw <package_name>

Pacman will download the package as <package_name>.tar.xz file and store it at “/var/cache/pacman/pkg” directory. In fact, all the Arch Linux packages are available in the .TAR.XZ format. Don’t worry; pacman can directly install a .TAR.XZ file provided that it’s a legit Arch Linux package file.

sudo pacman -U <package_name>.tar.xz

== Searching ==
If you’re confused with the package name, ask pacman to search it for you!

pacman -Ss <search_term>
or pacsearch <search term>

== Uninstallation ==
With pacman, uninstalling a package is more secure. Just run the following command:

sudo pacman -R <package_name>
