Hidden files
You can toggle the visibility of hidden files with the following command: :set show_hidden!, or use :set show_hidden true to make hidden files visible.

To make this permanent, add the setting to your configuration file:

rc.conf
set show_hidden true
Alternatively, hidden files can be toggled by pressing **zh**.

You can get help while using Ranger by pressing ?, followed by:

m: opens the man page for ranger
k: opens a list of keybindings
c: opens a list of available commands and descriptions
s: opens a list of settings and their current values

Navigation
Ranger uses many of the same keybindings as "vim". For instance, the movement commands mirror vim closely:

j = Move down
k = Move up
h = Move to parent directory
gg = Go to the top of the list
G = Go to the bottom of the list
<ctrl>-f = Page down
<ctrl>-b = Page up
J = Page down 1/2 page
K = Page up 1/2 page
H = Go back through navigation history
L = Go forward through navigation history

==Settings==
map zc    set collapse_preview!
map zd    set sort_directories_first!
map zh    set show_hidden!
map <C-h> set show_hidden!
copymap <C-h> <backspace>
copymap <backspace> <backspace2>
map zI    set flushinput!
map zi    set preview_images!
map zm    set mouse_enabled!
map zp    set preview_files!
map zP    set preview_directories!
map zs    set sort_case_insensitive!
map zu    set autoupdate_cumulative_size!
map zv    set use_preview_script!
map zf    console filter%space
copymap zf zz



There are also some directory-specific shortcuts to move to common directories:

gh = cd ~
ge = cd /etc
gu = cd /usr
gd = cd /dev
go = cd /opt
gv = cd /var
gm = cd /media
gM = cd /mnt
gs = cd /srv
gr = cd /
gR = cd to ranger's global configuration directory


Working with Files
Ranger allows you to perform many different operations on files from within its interface. Here are some of the most common:

i = Display file (useful if you'd like to view a text file in a pager instead of editing it)
l or E = Open file (opens file in default file-handler)
r = Open file withâ€¦ (allows you to choose program to use)
o = Change sort order (follow by character in menu selection)
z = Change settings (commonly used toggle settings)
zh = View hidden files
<space> = Select current file
t = Tag file (you can perform actions on tagged files)
cw = Rename current file
/ = Search for files
n = Jump to next match
N = Jump to previous match
yy = Yank (copy) file
dd = Mark file for cut operation
<delete> = Delete selected file


Tabbed Browsing
Ranger also incorporates tabbed functionality to allow multiple viewports into the filesystem. Here are the most common tab control keys:

<ctrl>-n = Create new tab
<ctrl>-w = Close current tab
<tab> = Next tab
<shift><tab> = Previous tab


General Commands
These commands control ranger itself:

? = View ranger man page
1? = Keybindings help
2? = Command help
3? = Settings help
R = Reload current directory
Q = Quit


Command Interface
Like vim, ranger also includes a robust command interface. This allows you to manipulate files in more complex ways. The abilities are extensive, so we will only be covering a few:

! = Execute a command from the shell (non-ranger commands)
: = Execute a ranger command
du = Measure disk usage of current directory
chmod = Change permissions of current file
There are a number of flags that you can pass to commands to modify the operation of the commands. They should be used with a dash "-" after typing "!" for shell commands or ":" for ranger commands:

-s = Discard the output of the current command.
-d = Detach the process and run in the background
-p = Return the output in ranger's file pager
-w = Do not return immediately after command execution. Hang until "Enter" is pressed
-c = Perform command on current file, not the selected files
