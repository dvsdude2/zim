Basic usage commands for pip
The pip command on your system will either be pip3 or just pip. We're going to use pip3 in these examples, but just be aware that you may need to change that command for your own system.

To see the version of pip and verify it's installed on the system:
$ pip3 -V

To install a __package:__
$ pip3 install package-name

To remove a package:
$ pip3 uninstall package-name

To search for a particular package:
$ pip3 search package-name

To see what packages are installed on your system:
$ pip3 list

To see information about a particular installed package:
$ pip3 show package-name

If you want to install it then the command is install:
**__python setup.py install__**


If you need to build the package first, use the build command before installing:
//**python setup.py build**//
