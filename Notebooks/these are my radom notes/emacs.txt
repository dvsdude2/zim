====== emacs ======
Created Friday 09 April 2021

Please note that Emacs represents **'Ctrl'** as **'**C**'** and '**Alt'** as **'**m**'**. So, for example, whenever you see something like C-x, it means **Ctrl**+x.

Like nano, you can directly open a file to edit in emacs in the following way:

**emacs -nw [filename]**
Note: The -nw flag makes sure emacs launches in bash itself, instead of a separate window which is the default behavior.

For example:
**emacs -nw test.txt**
Important note: to end the Emacs session, type C-x C-c.  (Two characters.)
To quit a partially entered command, type C-g.

=== terms used and the = of ===
kill = cut
<del>or delete = backspace
<M> meta = alt key
//**to undo**// = **Ctrl+/**  works for kill or delete
**Ctrl+g**... is a undo typed command
after making changes, if you want to save them, use **Ctrl+x** followed by **Ctrl+s**. The last section will show you a message saying something on the lines of **'Wrote ........' .**

Now, if you want to discard changes and quit the editor, use **Ctrl+x** followed by **Ctrl+c**. The editor will confirm this through a prompt

As for other basic editing operations, deleting is simple, as it works through the **Backspace/Delete keys** that most of us are already used to. However, there are shortcuts that make your deleting experience smooth. For example, use **Ctrl+k** for deleting complete line, **Alt+d** for deleting a word, and **Alt+k** for a sentence.
'''
  You can delete by words or lines
as well.  Here is a summary of the delete operations:

	<DEL>        Delete the character just before the cursor
	C-d   	     Delete the next character after the cursor

	M-<DEL>      Kill the word immediately before the cursor
	M-d	     Kill the next word after the cursor

	C-k	     Kill from the cursor position to end of line
	M-k	     Kill to the end of the current sentence
'''


to move to the bttm of screen and cont. **Ctrl+v**  to move back use **Alt+v**
hitting **Ctrl+l** repeadly will move the line the curser is on from top middle and bottom of screen

Here is a summary of simple cursor-moving operations, including the
word and sentence moving commands:

	C-f	Move forward a character
	C-b	Move backward a character

	M-f	Move forward a word
	M-b	Move backward a word

	C-n	Move to next line
	C-p	Move to previous line

	C-a	Move to beginning of line
	C-e	Move to end of line

	M-a	Move back to beginning of sentence
	M-e	Move forward to end of sentence
a number can be used to jump ahead or back using the c-u command first, 
the number, then command
