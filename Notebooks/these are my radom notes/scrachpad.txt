hint: Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is
hint: discouraged. You can squelch this message by running one of the following
hint: commands sometime before your next pull:
hint:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint:
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.



== after this has been fixed ==
Above I assumed that you are only using one branch, main. If you aren't already, I highly recommend that you create a new branch for each feature / bug fix that you work on. Among other benefits, this allows you to start work on another feature / bug fix when you are still waiting for an earlier PR to be merged. If you never commit directly to main, then you can sync without the --rebase or --force-with-lease:

git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
To update a feature branch after you have updated main, do:

git checkout myfeature
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease origin myfeature # if you have already pushed


[pull]
	rebase = true

git merge main
