Created Saturday 05 June 2021

You can run the **atom** command with one or more file paths to open up those files in Atom.

In addition to single character movement, there are a number of other movement keybindings:

Move to the beginning of word        - **Ctrl+Left** 
Move to the end of word              - **Ctrl+Right** 
Move to first character of line      - **Home** 
Move to the end of the line          - **End** 
Move to the top of the file          - **Ctrl+Home** 
Move to the bottom of the file       - **Ctrl+End**

===== Basic Manipulation =====
There are a handful of cool keybindings for basic text manipulation that might come in handy. These range from moving around lines of text and duplicating lines to changing the case.

Join line to end of the current line    - Ctrl+J       
Move the current line up or down        - Ctrl+Up/Down 
Duplicate the current line              - Ctrl+Shift+D 

===== Deleting and Cutting =====
You can also delete or cut text out of your buffer with some shortcuts. Be ruthless.

Delete current line                       - Ctrl+Shift+K   
Delete to beginning of word               - Ctrl+Backspace 
Delete to end of word                     - Ctrl+Delete    

===== Multiple Cursors and Selections =====
One of the cool things that Atom can do out of the box is support multiple cursors. This can be incredibly helpful in manipulating long lists of text.

Add a new cursor at the clicked location       - Ctrl+Click        
Add another cursor above/below cursor          - Alt+Shift+Up/Down 
Select next word that is same as selected      - Ctrl+D            
Select all words that are same as selected     - Alt+F3            

Using these commands you can place cursors in multiple places in your document and effectively execute the same commands in multiple places at once.

===== Find and Replace =====
Finding and replacing text in your file or project is quick and easy in Atom.

Search within a buffer                         - Ctrl+F       
Search the entire project                      - Ctrl+Shift+F 

If you launch either of those commands, you'll be greeted with the Find and Replace panel at the bottom of your screen.
